We apologise for the inconvenience!\n    - WARNING: As stated in #‼📜server-rules📜‼ under §6.1, we will check tribes if we suspect anything. Any illegal creature found will be killed/disposed of immediately and a warning will be issued for violating server rule §4.5.\n- Engram `M+ Mutation Stat Propagator` activated:\n  - Mating interval has been corrected and now corresponds to our server settings\n  - Mutation buff has been adjusted\n    - Max. 1 buff possible, i.e. there will always be a 100% chance of a baby with +2 mutation in one status value\n    - Cost of mutation buff adjusted to 200 coins. \n\n- Max. Player level has been adjusted to 105 (without any extra levels from ascension, explorer notes, BBT notes, chibi, runes) \n╰➤ You must use a mindwipe to correct your levels. If you still do not have the correct levels as intended, please open a REPORT TICKET in our discord \n\n- In-game shop: \n  - Dinos & items will be added (no ETA), but we need to rework the whole price lists before we can do that. \n  - We are also working on using GSA in the future for in game shop, dono shop and automated reward system and more (no ETA).
